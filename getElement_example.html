<!-- An example showing you how to access all the content on a web page and use it to display a new message -->

<html>
<head>
	<title>Accessing all contents</title>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		function getValue()
		{
			var dog = document.getElementById("puppy");
			document.write("Your dog is not a terrier <br />");
			document.write("Your dog is a ");
			document.write(dog.innerHTML);
		}
	</script>
</head>
<body>
	<h1 id = "puppy" onclick="getValue()">Poodle</h1>
	<!-- In this example we have a container with the id puppy which contains the breed of the dog-->
	<!-- Here, dog is set to the content of the container named puppy. The innerHTML property sets or 
		returns the inner HTML of an element. Thus, we display the inner HTML of the variable dog.
		Additionally, we use the getElementByID() method to retrieve the contents of the container and
		then display that content using the write() method. This is of course a simplified example.-->
