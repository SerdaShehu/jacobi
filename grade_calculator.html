<!-- Write a program that displays a students grade on an exam. The exam has 21 questions. The basic score is based on the first 10 question, with 5 points being given for each correct answer. The last question is an extra credit option worth 6 to 10 points. Ask the student for the initial score on the exam. Then, ask them for the score on the extra credit portion. -->
