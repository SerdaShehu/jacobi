<!-- Welcome to the troll adventure game.
Let us have a virtual battle. Imagine that you are writing code for an online adventure game. You come to a battle, and the winner is determined as follows. If the player arrives with more points than the troll is assigned, the player wins. If the player arrives with fewer points than the troll but has acquired a gun or sword in the game, the player also wins. Finally, if the player and the troll have the same number of points, the battle is declared a tie. A tie is also declared if the player cannot win but has wings or has acquired flying dust and flies away. In all other cases, the player loses. Let the program assign the troll 50 points. -->
