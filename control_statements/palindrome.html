<!-- A palindrome is a number or a text phrase that reads the same backward and forward. For example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554, 11611. Write a script that reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether it’s a palindrome. If the number is not five digits long, display an alert dialog indicating the problem to the user. Allow the user to enter a new value after dismissing the alert dialogue. [hint: try using both division and remainder operations to “pick-off” each digit] -->
