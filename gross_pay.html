<!-- An employer wants you to create a program that will allow her to enter an employeeâ€™s name, 
hourly rate of pay, number of hours worked in one week, and overtime pay rate. The program should output the employees 
gross pay (before taxes and deductions). This program could be augmented in the future for multiple objects-->
